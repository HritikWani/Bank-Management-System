The BMS project is a application based small project for banking operations.
The project aims to satisfy customer requirements such as 
        1. creating a personalised account.
        2. deposit money.
        3. withdraw money.
        4. generating transaction mini statement.
        5. balance enquiry.
There is an admin module where admin can
        1. check kyc information.
        2. update kyc information.
        3. and check transaction records.
There are more features such as filters to see specific transactions and user accounts in admin module.
Few of these features are extended to user module as well.
With simplicity and effectivity I hope to ease these facilities for users.
